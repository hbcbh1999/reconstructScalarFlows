# reconstructScalarFlows

This is the code accompanying our data set ScalarFlow https://ge.in.tum.de/publications/2019-scalarflow-eckert/. With this code, we capture real-world scalar flow phenomena: we calibrate cameras, control and record smoke plumes, post-process captured videos, reconstruct 3D density and 3D velocity from the 2D captured images, and post-processing reconstructed quantities. The reconstruction code is embedded in mantaflow http://mantaflow.com/.
