How to install:

SERVO
- Build and install servoblaster according to the instructions. (Needs to be built ON THE PI)
- Copy servohost.sh to /usr/local/bin/
- Copy servo.service to /etc/systemd/system/
- Enable the service with "sudo systemctl enable servo.service"

STEPPER
- Run build.sh in the 'c' folder to build the application and the lib.
  THIS MUST BE BUILT ON THE PI!
- Copy
    motorclient.py
    stepper.sh
    c/stepper
    c/stepper.so
  to /usr/local/sbin/stepper/

- Copy stepper.service to /etc/systemd/system/
- Enable the service with "sudo systemctl enable stepper.service"

NOTE: Currently the host-ip is hardcoded in the stepper.sh script.
